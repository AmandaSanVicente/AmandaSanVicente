Along the way, I have come across a way to do so-Analysis! 

My career begin in customer service. I have been in different types of industries from auto loans, auto sales, cellular, sales referral, survey questionnaire, medical leave, dispatcher, to telecommunications. Over time I have seen how the impact that technology has on the different industries. This discovery sparked my interest in business intelligence analysis, where I could combine my customer service in the different industries with problem-solving to help build future solutions.

To build my expertise, I completed the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program, gaining hands-on experience in Power BI, Tableau, Python, and SQL full-stack development. Through real-world projects, I analyzed data and provided solutions that would help companies make future marketing decisions.  

Now I am eager to apply my new skills as a business intelligence analyst to help with innovative solutions and to combine my knowledge in customer service to further assist in future developments. Outside of work, I love learning new ways to cook different types of meals and thinking outside the box for a meal. If I am not in the kitchen you can find me reading a book in a quite conner.</p><p align='left'> You can view my resume <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IYrgjj92Ylyr1YTAKkM1apE7esPEPhsxjXD9K2EC1MM/edit?usp=sharing ' target=_blank><u>here</u>.</a></p>
